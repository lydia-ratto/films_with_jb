The Silence of the Lambs,3/1/2022,Thriller/Crime,N,N,9,Amazon,118,96%,8.6,Very chilling vibe right from the first scene when she's running through the misty woods. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are both so good. She makes a great heroine. Thought it was clever the way the camera was always focussed on people's eyes whether it was his creepy eyes or men ogling her or her looking all tough. All round top stuff.,Jonathan Demme,1,1991,
Friends With Money,3/1/2022,Comedy/Drama,N,N,8.5,Netflix,88,72%,5.8,I thought it was great - paints a very realistic/varied portrait of what it might be like to be that age. Covers a lot of ground - money/careers/relationships/mortality in a subtle way and has a great cast. Ended a little too quickly but better than it going on too long. Ty Burrell and Simon McBurney's relationship was really funny too. I think everyone could find a character (or two) that they relate to which was good. I think I related to Jennifer Aniston haha.,Nicole Holofcener,2,2006,
Spiderman: No Way Home,4/1/2022,Action/Comedy,Y,N,7.5,Finchley Vue,148,93%,8.3,"Mostly pretty enjoyable - I think Spiderman is probs one of the best of the genre because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Superheroes are ultimately silly and I feel like Spiderman films are usually aware of that. Lots of plotholes because it's multiverse stuff but that didn't matter too much (why doesn't Dr S just fix everything/Tom Holland is at fault for all this dumb stuff when he could have just reapplied for uni or whatever/why were there not more spidermen from other universes?). They did the bit with the other spidermen really well I thought - Tobey Maguire was funny & good. Don't get why marvel films are all lit so weirdly though, at nearly no point do any of the characters look like they're where they're supposed to be.",Jon Watts,3,2021,
The Gentlemen,5/1/2022,Action/Comedy,N,N,7.5,Netflix,113,75%,7.8,Hugh Grant and Colin Farrell were especially good - Colin Farrell should do more funny roles. Entertaining and I enjoyed the script but it didn't have the same style as Snatch for example. It never really felt like it was really the criminal underworld you know? Still worth a watch though.,Guy Ritchie,4,2020,
Licorice Pizza,7/1/2022,Drama/Comedy,Y,N,9,Finchley Vue,133,91%,7.9,"All round great fun movie - a fun world to be a part of for a couple of hours & it's really good on first love/wrong attraction/whatever. Both the leads are great, mad that they've never acted before because they have a lot to do here. Bradley Cooper is the best of some pretty good side characters. Lot's of running scenes, maybe the motorbike one being the best. Looking forward to seeing it again.",Paul Thomas Anderson,5,2021,https://twitter.com/lauren_wilford/status/1477456147791634432?t=BtT-ICndaTXVyhQldkOzHg&s=08
The 400 Blows,8/1/2022,Drama/Comedy,N,N,8,BFI NFT 1,98,98%,8.1,"Not as groundbreaking as I thought it would be maybe, but the kid was aamazing and  it did look great. I liked the ambiguity of it, never signalling to the audience what they should think about any of it. Quite sad in some ways but plenty of humour in it too. I'd like to see it again/see the sequels though.",Fran√ßois Truffaut,6,1959,
Moonrise Kingdom,11/1/2022,Comedy/Romance,N,N,8,Netflix,93,93%,7.8,"Probably in the top half of Anderson movies for me. A simpler story than some but very sweet without quite as much style as The French Dispatch (but he really loves yellow). Similar themes to Licorice Pizza in a way - young love and naivety. I think his quirkiness really suits a scout camp - in my experience the film is full of the sort of weird dramas that fill a week away from your parents at that age and make it feel like an incredibly significant week, until the next one. Bruce Willis is good too, he should do more stuff like this.",Wes Anderson,7,2012,
The Hunt (Jagten),12/1/2022,Drama,N,N,9,Amazon,115,93%,8.3,"Incredibly hard to watch in places, in some ways you could argue it's a horror film. The premise is great but the script really makes it something better - every point in the story makes you wince and it really feels like it could all happen and there's nothing you could do about it. Great ambiguous ending too - at first I thought perhaps he had imagined it and he was having flashbacks to being hunted again, but it could also be Karla's older brother shooting at him I suppose. Mads obviously great.",Thomas Vinterberg,8,2012,
